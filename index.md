## About Me

Hello! My name is Rahul and i'm a Masters Student majoring in Computer Engineering (Machine Intelligence) at Virginia Tech. I work on projects in the feilds of **machine learning, deep learning, computer vision and atural language processing.** I currently work as a graduate research assistant at **wireless @ VT** under the mentorship of **Dr. Jeffrey Reed, Dr. Nishith Tripathi and Dr. Vijay Shah** .My current work is focused using vehicular communications and artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency and security of traffic intersections. Recently, I started working in the feild of Non Terrestrial networks.
Apart from work , I like hiking and photography. I am also an avid anime fan with One Piece and Demon Slayer being my current favorites. I was a part of the toastmasters International club where i served as a Vice president membership for the past year. During my undergraduate studies, i served as the sargent at arms for the club.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** image classification, object detection, image captioning, video captioning.
- **Machine Learning:** Supervised Learning, Un-supervised learning, Tabular data , Time series forcasting, anomaly detection.
- **Natural Language Processing:** News Summarization, Sentiment Analysis, Text classification.

## Projects

### Project 1: [Image Classification and Captioning- Advisor: Dr. Jason Xuan](https://github.com/RahulVarmaC/DeepLearning/tree/main/ConvNets)
- Created a classifier to clasify 10 different types of objects using various architectures like VGG-16, RESNET and Y-CNN with a 92 % accuracy.
- Created an image captioning tool to caption given images using the CNN-RNN architecture to summarize the entire image using words with a 70% Bleu Score.

### Project 2: [News Article Summarization - Advisor: Dr. Jason Xuan](https://github.com/RahulVarmaC/News-Summarization-Using-Transformers)
- Used the T5-Small and the Pegasus transformer models to fine tune X-Sum Dataset containing news articles for text summarization.
- Summarized news articles using the fine tuned models into a 128-word summary and concluded that Pegasustransformer summarized articles better based on rogue scores.

### Project 3: [Disease Outbreak Prediction- Advisor Dr. Jia Bin Huang](https://github.com/RahulVarmaC/Anomaly-Detection-using-unsupervised-learning)
- Created an anomaly detector using isolation forest and dB Scan unsupervised machine learning models to detect anomalies in Covid-19 throughout the pandemic released by the Italy health Department.
- Theorized and proved that there is a high chance of outbreaks shortly after the occurrences of these anomaliesusing unsupervised deep learning algorithms and deduced that there is a 7 day gap between an anomaly and an outbreak.

### Project 4: [Heart Stroke Classification - Advisor: Dr.Creed Jones](https://github.com/RahulVarmaC/MachineLearning/tree/main/Heart-Stroke-prediction)
- Performed Exploratory data analysis, imputed missing values using statistical methods and linear regression, performed feature engineering which increased the model performance by 15% when compared to the baseline model.
- Conducted a comparative study of supervised machine learning algorithms with random forest algorithm giving the best accuracy of 95%.

### Project 5: [Digit Recognizer- Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rahulvarmac/basic-mlp-digit-recognizer)
- Prepared the data, performed EDA, split the data into training and validation sets, constructed a deep neural network architecture to classify the digits.
- Achieved a 97 % accuracy on test data in the leaderboard.
